# Let’s run an experiment! Self-selection at HBC Digital.

![Self-selection](http://i.imgur.com/DGJx44J.png)

Inspired by Opower’s success story, we run a self-selection experiment at HBC Digital. 

Dubbed as _“the most anticipated event of the year”_ it enabled 39 team members to self-select into 4 project teams. How did they do it? By picking a project they wanted to work on, the teammates they wanted to work with and keeping _“Do what’s best for the company”_ attitude. 
Read on to learn about our experience and consider giving a self-selection a try!


## A little bit of introduction: 

### Who are we?
HBC Digital is the group that drives the digital retail/ecommerce and digital customer experience across all HBC retail banners including Hudson’s Bay, Lord & Taylor, Saks Fifth Avenue, Gilt, and Saks OFF 5TH. 

### Our process, trifectas and team ingredients

Our development process is largely inspired by original [Gilt process](http://tech.gilt.com/2013/03/07/scaling-agile-at-gilt) and has the ideas of intrinsic motivation in its core. 
What agile flavor do we use? It depends on a team.
Each team has a full autonomy in selecting Scrum, Kanban, XP, a combination thereof or none of the above as their process. As long as they remain small, nimble, able to collaborate and continuously deliver value, they can tailor the process to their needs.
We do keep certain key components standard across all teams. One of them is a “Trifecta” – a group of servant-leaders in each team: a Product Manager, an Agile Project Manager and a Tech Lead. They work together to support their team and enable the team's success. 
We value continuous learning and facilitate role blending by instilling our Team Ingredients framework. Originally designed by Heather Fleming, [Team Ingredients](https://www.slideshare.net/hhfleming/the-new-work-order-team-ingredients-and-role-blending) framework facilitates team-level conversations about the team strength, learning interests and cross-training opportunities. Over the years the framework evolved from being a management tool for assessing teams from "outside in" to being a team tool that supports self-organizing and learning discussions.

Just like our Team Ingredients framework, our process continues to evolve. We experiment with new ideas and practices to facilitate teams’ effectiveness and create an environment for teams to thrive. The self-selection is our latest experiment and this blog post is a glimpse into how it went. 

## Self-selection triggers and enablers

### Organizational change

As an organization that grew through acquisitions, at one point we found ourselves dealing with an unhealthy mix of cultures, duplicate roles and clashing mindsets. To remain lean and agile, we went through a restructuring at all levels. 

### Inspiring case studies

When we were evaluating the best ways to re-form the teams, we came across Amber King and Jess Huth’s talk on [self-selection](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVyt62kZKiA) at Business Agility 2017 Conference. The lightbulb went on! Amber and Jess were describing exactly the situation we were in at that time and were reporting the positive effect of running a self-selection with the teams at Opower. We followed up with them on Skype afterwards. Hearing their compelling story again and being encouraged by their guidance, we left the call fired up to give the self-selection a try!

### Self-selection manual

When it is your turn to plan for self-selection, pick up a copy of Sandy Mamoli and David Mole’s book [“Creating Great Teams: How Self-Selection Lets People Excel”](https://www.amazon.com/Creating-Great-Teams-Self-Selection-People/dp/1680501283)
This very detailed facilitation guide from the inventors of self-selection process is indispensable in preparing for and facilitating a self-selection event. 

### Past success

What worked in our favor was the fact that Gilt had tried running a self-selection in 2012 as part of a transition to pizza-sized teams. The self-selection event was called a Speed Dating, involved 50 people and 6 projects. Fun fact - a number of today's leaders were involved in 2012 event as regular participants.

### Transparency

We kept the preparation process very transparent. Dedicated Slack channel, Confluence page with progress updates and participants’ info, communication at the tech all-hands meetings and Q&A sessions – everything to avoid creating discomfort and to reduce a fear factor amongst the team members. 
 
## Self-selection in seven steps

![Seven Steps of Self-Selection](http://i.imgur.com/g74dlgH.png)

### 1. Get Leadership Buy-In

One of the first steps in self-selection is getting a buy-in from your leadership team. 
Wheather you start from [feature teams or component teams](http://www.innolution.com/blog/distinguishing-between-feature-component-teams), a self-selection event has a potential of impacting your existing reporting structure in organization. 
Have an open conversation with each of the leaders to clarify the process, understand their conserns and answer questions. 
Is there a small modification you can make to the process to mitigate these conserns and turn the leaders into your supporters? 
From our experience, making self-selection participation invitational and positioning it as an experiment fast-tracked the acceptance in the organization.

### 2. Identify Participants

How many people will be involved in self-selection? 
Will all existing project teams will be participating? 

If you are running a self-selection for a subset of the teams, make sure that the list of participants is known and publicly available to everyone. Verify that the total number of participants is equal or smaller than the number of open spots on the new teams. 

#### Pre-selected vs. free-moving participants

The only two roles that were pre-selected for each initiative were a Product Manager and a Tech Lead roles. Everyone else, including Agile Project Managers were allowed to self-select into new teams. 

#### FTEs vs. Contractors

Since our typical team has a mix of a full-time employees and contractors, it was logical to invite both groups to participate in self-selection. Afterall, individuals were selecting the teams based on the business idea, technology stack and the other individuals that they wanted to work with.
We did make one adjustment to the process and asked contractors to give employees a "fist dip" at selecting new teams. Everone had same opportunty after the first selection iteration.

#### Observers

There was so much interest in the self-selection experiment from others, not directly involved in it, that we had to invent an observer role.
Observers were invited to join in the first part of the self-selection event, they could listen to initiative pitches for all teams (without making an actual selection).
Observers were asked to leave after the break, just before the start of actual teams selection.

### 3. Work with Your Key Partners 
Build-in some time for group and one-on-one coaching.
Adjust the process if required
1) “I have no squad” poster was replaced with “I am available to help”
2)  Compromise on consultants’ participation
3) “No first come-first serve” rule.
Product Managers and Tech Leads pitches.
- coach them to inspire people with product vision and technology stack.
Establish the team composition (core team + larger community) 
- front end, back end, APM, UX, Infra, Data, QA
- cross-checking the team needs with the number of participants. --> no musical chairs!
### 4. Evangelize 
We learnt to use a variety of channels to spread the word about self-selection.
1) announcement at Tech All-hands meeting
2) Q&A sessions with each existing group.
3) Confluence Q&A page
4) #self-selection Slack channel
5) formal and informal one-on-one conversations
### 5. Prepare
#### Space
1) Appropriate for the size of the group
2) Natural light
3) Separate space for pitches and for team posters
4) Away from the usual team spaces (to minimize distractions)
#### Food
[Do Food](https://www.amazon.com/Fearless-Change-Patterns-Introducing-Ideas/dp/0201741571) pattern applies here as well.
Depending on the time of the day, plan on bringing breakfast, lunch or snacks into your self-selection event. We run ours in the afternoon and brought in chocolate, popcorn and organic juices.
#### Posters
1) one team poster per each team with the project /team name, required team composition and a team mascot. Make it visually appealing, be creative. Repeat the information from the pitches for clarity.

2) Rules poster(s). At a minimum have “Do what’s best for the company” poster.
As we added a few additional rule, those were outlined on a poster as well.

3) “I am available to help” poster. This is very similar to “I have no squad” poster from Sandi Mamoli’s book. However, we wanted to make the message on that poster a little bit more positive. We were planning to ask more people to put their names there in the first self-selection round
#### Participants Cards

At a minimum, have photos with names prepared for each participants. 
We invested a little more time to simplify a discussion about team's learning opportunities and make participants card look like game cards. 
Using our Team ingredients framework and Kahoot! survey platform we created a gamified self-assessment.
Participants rated their skill levels and learning interests for each of the 11 ingredients using the following scale:
3 – I can teach it
2 – I can do it
1 – I’d like to learn it
0 – Don’t make me do it.
Data collected via Kahoot was later used to generate the individual participants’ cards. Every participant received a card with their photo, name, current role and team ingredients scale.
Additional space was provided to indicate their first, second and third project choices during the event.
