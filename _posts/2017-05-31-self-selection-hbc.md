# Let’s run an experiment! Self-selection at HBC Digital.

Inspired by Opower’s success story, we run a self-selection experiment at HBC Digital. 

Dubbed as _“the most anticipated event of the year”_ it enabled 39 team members to self-select into 4 project teams. How did they do it? By picking a project they wanted to work on, the teammates they wanted to work with and keeping _“Do what’s best for the company”_ attitude. 
Read on to learn about our experience and consider giving a self-selection a try!


## A little bit of introduction: 

### Who are we?
HBC Digital is the group that drives the digital retail/ecommerce and digital customer experience across all HBC retail banners including Hudson’s Bay, Lord & Taylor, Saks Fifth Avenue, Gilt, and Saks OFF 5TH. 

### Our process, trifectas and team ingredients

Our development process is largely inspired by original [Gilt process](http://tech.gilt.com/2013/03/07/scaling-agile-at-gilt) and has the ideas of intrinsic motivation in its core. 
What agile flavor do we use? It depends on a team.
Each team has a full autonomy in selecting Scrum, Kanban, XP, a combination thereof or none of the above as their process. As long as they remain small, nimble, able to collaborate and continuously deliver value, they can tailor the process to their needs.
We do keep certain key components standard across all teams. One of them is a “Trifecta” – a group of servant-leaders in each team: Product Manager, Agile Project Manager and Tech Lead. They work together to support the teams and enable the teams’ success. 
Additionally, we enable continuous learning and role blending by instilling our [Team Ingredients framework](https://www.slideshare.net/hhfleming/the-new-work-order-team-ingredients-and-role-blending). 

Our process continues to evolve. We experiment with new ideas and practices to facilitate teams’ effectiveness and create a culture and an environment for them to thrive. The self-selection is our latest experiment and this blog post is a glimpse into how it went. 

## Self-selection triggers and enablers

### Organizational change

Just like any other organization that grew through acquisitions, at one point we found ourselves dealing with an unhealthy mix of cultures, duplicate roles and clashing mindsets. To remain lean and agile, we went through a restructuring at all levels. 

### Inspiring case studies

As we were evaluating the best ways to re-form the teams, we came across Amber King and Jess Huth’s talk on [self-selection](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVyt62kZKiA) at Business Agility 2017 Conference. The lightbulb went on! Amber and Jess were describing exactly the situation we were in at that time and were reporting the positive effect of running a self-selection with the teams at Opower. We followed up with them on Skype afterwards. Hearing their compelling story again and being encouraged by their guidance, we left the call fired up to give the self-selection a try!

### Self-selection manual

When it is your turn to plan for self-selection, pick up a copy of Sandy Mamoli and David Mole’s book [“Creating Great Teams: How Self-Selection Lets People Excel”](https://www.amazon.com/Creating-Great-Teams-Self-Selection-People/dp/1680501283)
This very detailed facilitation guide from the inventors of self-selection process was indispensable in preparing and facilitating our event. 

### Leadership support.

One of the first steps in self-selection is getting a buy-in from the leadership team. 
What worked in our favor was the fact that Gilt had tried running a self-selection in the past and in general always supported idea of teams’ mobility. Last but not least, positioning the self-selection as an experiment, gained stronger support for it at all levels. 

### Transparency
We kept the preparation process very transparent. Dedicated Slack channel, Confluence page with progress updates and participants’ info, communication at the tech all-hands meetings and Q&A sessions – everything to avoid creating discomfort and to reduce a fear factor amongst the team members. 
 
## How can you prepare for a self-selection?
### 1. 
Decide who will participate
- Participants:
- - Pre-selected
- - Free-moving 
- - Contractors
- Observers

### 2. Find space
1) Appropriate for the size of the group
2) Natural light
3) Separate space for pitches and for team posters
4) Away from the usual team spaces (to minimize distractions)

### 3. Evangelize 
We learnt to use a variety of channels to spread the word about self-selection.
1) announcement at Tech All-hands meeting
2) Q&A sessions with each existing group.
3) Confluence Q&A page
4) #self-selection Slack channel
5) formal and informal one-on-one conversations

### 4. Partner with your Key players 
Build-in some time for group and one-on-one coaching.
Adjust the process if required
1) “I have no squad” poster was replaced with “I am available to help”
2)  Compromise on consultants’ participation
3) “No first come-first serve” rule.
Product Managers and Tech Leads pitches.
- coach them to inspire people with product vision and technology stack.
Establish the team composition (core team + larger community) 
- front end, back end, APM, UX, Infra, Data, QA
- cross-checking the team needs with the number of participants. --> no musical chairs!

### 5. Assess participants’ level of skills and learning interests
We used our Team ingredients framework and turned it into a self-assessment.
In preparation for this large event we gamified and automated it using Kahoot! Survey platform. 
Participants rated their skill level and learning interest for each of the 11 ingredients using the following scale:
3 – I can teach it
2 – I can do it
1 – I’d like to learn it
0 – Don’t make me do it.
Data collected via Kahoot was later used to generate the individual participants’ cards.

### 6. Prepare Participants cards
At a minimum, have photos with names prepared for each participants. We invested a little more time to make participants card looks like game cards. Every participant received a card with their photo, name, current role and team ingredients scale.
“Your photo is a fresh as your LinkedIn profile!”
Additional space was provided to indicate their first, second and third project choices during the event.

### 7. Do food
This [Fearless Change](https://www.amazon.com/Fearless-Change-Patterns-Introducing-Ideas/dp/0201741571) pattern applies here as well.
Depending on the time of the day, plan on bringing breakfast, lunch or snacks into your self-selection event. We run ours in the afternoon and brought in chocolate, popcorn and organic juices.

### 8. Prepare posters
    You will need 
1) one team poster per each team with the project /team name, required team composition and a team mascot. Make it visually appealing, be creative. Repeat the information from the pitches for clarity.
2) Rules poster(s). At a minimum have “Do what’s best for the company” poster.
As we added a few additional rule, those were outlined on a poster as well.
3) “I am available to help” poster. This is very similar to “I have no squad” poster from Sandi Mamoli’s book. However, we wanted to make the message on that poster a little bit more positive. We were planning to ask more people to put their names there in the first self-selection round
