At AWS re:Invent, Emerson Loureiro, Senior Software Engineer at Gilt, lead two huge sessions on our journey from a single monolithic Rails application to more than 300 Scala/Java microservices deployed in the cloud. There are plenty of important lessons packed into this hour long talk so we're very happy to be able to share a video of the talk with you.
