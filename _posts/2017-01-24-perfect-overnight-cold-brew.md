When Gilt’s Mobile team worked at [1 Madison Avenue](https://www.emporis.com/buildings/115458/metropolitan-life-tower-new-york-city-ny-usa), my morning coffee ritual involved getting a large black iced coffee from [myWayCup](https://www.yelp.com/biz/mywaycup-coffee-new-york) while exiting the 6 train at 23rd Street. The iced coffee served at myWayCup—a private-label version of [Intelligentsia Coffee’s](https://www.intelligentsiacoffee.com) House Blend—was *so* good that I switched to drinking iced coffee year-round, even through brutal New York winters.

About a year later when the Mobile team moved back up to the [2 Park Avenue](https://www.emporis.com/buildings/115237/2-park-avenue-new-york-city-ny-usa) office, I searched the neighborhood for iced coffee I liked as much, but came up empty. The cold brews I sampled tended to be syrupy and super-concentrated; meanwhile, the hot brew process of making iced coffee heated all the subtlety out of the beans, leaving a jagged, edgy texture. And all too often, in the wintertime, some stores didn’t turn over iced coffee frequently enough, so you’d end up with a coffee that had become stale after a few days of storage.

Without a local favorite, I started experimenting with making my own iced coffee. At times, there were catastrophic failures. At least two glass French press carafes gave their lives in the pursuit of coffee perfection, and an otherwise white wall at the office somehow acquired a coffee stain arcing down towards the floor. I even managed to melt one of my coffee grinders on top of a stove.

But despite these setbacks, the technique continued to evolve and improve, and I eventually went from the laborious process of a rapid-cooled hot brew to the simpler (but far lengthier) process of an overnight cold brew. True, the element of instant gratification is gone: my coffee intake now requires a day’s advance planning, but the result is a well-balanced brew. It’s not the thick, need-to-dilute-it-with-water cold brew that used to get delivered to our office in metal kegs. Nor is it the unrefined taste of beans that have had violence done to them by exposure to extreme heat followed by rapid cooling.

To me, this is the perfect iced coffee.

**What I use to brew:**

- [Intelligentsia House Blend](https://www.intelligentsiacoffee.com/house-blend) beans: Delicious coffee, full-bodied but not over-roasted or overly bitter. Using beans as opposed to getting pre-ground coffee ensures maximum freshness when you brew. Ground coffee oxidizes quickly and will soon taste stale if stored. (I use Intelligentsia’s mail order subscription service so I’m never out of fresh beans.)

- A [Bodum Bistro Electric Burr Grinder](http://amzn.to/2jS6YGM): This is a _conical burr grinder_, which means the grounds come out a consistent granularity. Most home coffee grinders are blade grinders, and the resulting grounds will be a random mix of fine and coarse bits. In a French press, fine grounds will not be caught by the mesh filter; those grounds will end up on your tongue like silt and the result will not be pleasant drinking. If you love coffee and you use a French press, you should consider buying a conical burr grinder.

- A 51oz (1.5 liter) [Bodum Chambord French Press](http://amzn.to/2jfs14p). This size yields about 2-3 days worth of coffee at my rate of consumption, which is ideal; beyond 3 days, the coffee would be getting stale anyway.

- A pitcher of NYC tap water filtered through a [Brita](http://amzn.to/2jSjKVN).

I start the brewing process in the morning before going to work, and I keep the French press on the counter until nighttime so I can stir periodically when I get the chance. Then, when I go to bed, I put the carafe in the fridge so it’s cold and ready to consume when I wake up the next morning.

**The brewing steps I follow:**

1. Set the grinder’s coarseness dial one notch to the left of the French Press icon.

2. Set the grinder to grind for 15 seconds.

3. Fill the hopper with beans.

4. Press the grind button and wait for it to be done.

5. Take the fresh grounds out of the grinder—be sure to stop and smell the coffee—and dump them in the glass carafe of the French press. Return any unground beans remaining in the hopper to an airtight container.

6. Fill the carafe to nearly to the top with cold filtered water.

7. Stir the water and grounds together for about 15 seconds.

8. Cover the top of the carafe with cellophane wrap or aluminum foil to avoid excess exposure to air.

9. Leave out at room temperature for 16 hours, stirring periodically for 15 seconds if possible. (I usually end up stirring about 5 times or so for the typical batch.)

10. Put in fridge for the final 8 hours.

11. Remove from fridge and stir for 15 seconds.

12. Press the coffee and serve.

13. Store what remains in an airtight container, and consume within 3 days.

Overall, it’s a 24-hour process, although there are some tricks you can use to cut down to on brew time. More frequent stirring helps you shorten the process a bit, as does repeated pressing at the end. (Pressing the grounds, removing the press, stirring the grounds, and pressing again.) You can adjust according to your equipment and tastes, but to allow the flavors to fully develop, I’d suggest a minimum of 16 hours brew time.

If you like iced coffee, give it a try. I hope you enjoy it as much as I do!
