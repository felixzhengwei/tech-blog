During the time that Gilt's Mobile team worked at [1 Madison Avenue](https://www.emporis.com/buildings/115458/metropolitan-life-tower-new-york-city-ny-usa), my morning coffee ritual involved picking up a large black iced coffee at [myWayCup](https://www.yelp.com/biz/mywaycup-coffee-new-york) on the way out of the 6 train at 23rd Street. The iced coffee served at myWayCup—a private-label version of [Intelligentsia's House Blend](https://www.intelligentsiacoffee.com/house-blend)—was *so* good that I switched to drinking iced coffee year-round, even through brutal New York winters.

When the Mobile team moved back up to [2 Park Avenue](https://www.emporis.com/buildings/115237/2-park-avenue-new-york-city-ny-usa), I searched for iced coffee I liked as much, but came up empty. The cold brews tended to be syrupy and super-concentrated; the hot-brewed iced coffees heated all the subtlety out of the beans, leaving a jagged, edgy texture. And all too often, in the wintertime, some stores didn't turn over iced coffee frequently enough, and it became stale after a few days of storage.

Without a local favorite, I started experimenting with making my own. These experiments took a while and at times there were catastrophic failures. At least 2 glass French Press carafes gave their lives in the pursuit of coffee perfection, and an otherwise white wall at the office inexplicably acquired a coffee stain arcing down towards the floor. 

But despite these setbacks, gradually the technique evolved and improved, and I went from the relatively labor-intensive process of a rapid-cooled hot brew to the simpler (but lengthier) process of an overnight cold brew.

True, the element of instant gratification is gone: my coffee intake now requires a day's advance planning, but the result is a well-balanced iced coffee. It's not the thick  need-to-dilute-it-with-water cold brew that used to get delivered to our office in metal kegs. Nor is it the unrefined taste of beans that have had violence done to them by extended exposure to heat before being cooled.

To me, it's the perfect iced coffee.

Here's what I use to make it:

- Intelligentsia House Blend beans: Delicious coffee, full-bodied but not over-roasted or bitter. Buying beans as opposed to getting pre-ground coffee ensures maximum freshness when you brew. Ground coffee oxidizes quickly and will soon taste stale if it is stored.

- A Bodum Bistro Electric Burr Grinder: This is a _conical burr grinder_, which means the grounds come out a consistent granularity. Most home coffee grinders are blade grinders, and the resulting grounds will be a random mix of fine and coarse bits. In a French press, fine grounds will not be caught by the mesh filter; those grounds will end up on your tongue like silt and the result will not be pleasant. If you love coffee and you use a French press, you should invest in a conical burr grinder. I've had two of these over the years and they've served me well. (I can speak for experience that they are quite durable as long as you don't leave one on a hot stove.)

- A 51oz (1.5 liter) Bodum Chambord French Press. This size yields about 2-3 days worth of coffee for my consumption, which is perfect; beyond 3 days, the coffee would be getting stale anyway.

- A pitcher of NYC tap water filtered through a Brita

I start the brewing process in the morning, before going to work, and I keep the French press on the counter until nighttime so I can stir periodically when I get the chance. Then, when I go to bed, I put the carafe in the fridge so it's cold and ready to consume when I wake up the next morning.

Here are the brewing steps I follow:

1. Set the grinder to the level of penultimate coarseness. (One notch to the left of where the French Press icon is on the Bodum Bistro grinder on the right side of the dial.)

2. Set the grinder to grind for 15 seconds.

3. Fill the hopper with beans.

4. Press the grind button and wait for it to be done.

5. Take the fresh grounds out of the grinder—be sure to stop and smell the coffee—and dump them in the glass carafe of the French press. Return any unground beans remaining in the hopper to an airtight container.

6. Fill the carafe to nearly to the top with cold filtered water.

7. Stir the water and grounds together for about 15 seconds.

8. Cover the top of the carafe with Press-n-Seal to avoid excess exposure to air.

9. Leave out at room temperature for 16 hours, stirring periodically for 15 seconds if possible. (I usually end up stirring about 5 times or so for the typical batch.)

10. Put in fridge for the final 8 hours.

11. Remove from fridge and stir for 15 seconds.

12. Press the coffee and serve.

13. Store what remains in an airtight container, and consume within 3 days.

Overall, it's a 24-hour process, although there are some tricks you can use to cut down to on brew time. More frequent stirring helps you shorten the process a bit, as does repeated pressing at the end. (Pressing the grounds, removing the press, stirring the grounds, and pressing again.) You can adjust according to your equipment and tastes, but to allow the flavors to fully develop, I'd suggest a minimum of 16 hours brew time.
