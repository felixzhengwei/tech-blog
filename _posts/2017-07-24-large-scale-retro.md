Can you recall the size and length of your typical retrospective?
If your team operates by [The Scrum Guide](http://www.scrumguides.org/docs/scrumguide/v2016/2016-Scrum-Guide-US.pdf), your retrospectives likely have less than ten people in one room, and last about an hour for a two-weeks Sprint.

What if your current team is larger than a typical Scrum team and a retrospective period is longer than a month? What if the team members are distributed across locations, countries, time zones and multiple third party vendors? Is this retrospective doomed to fail? Not quite.
These factors just add an additional complexity and call for a different facilitation approach. 

Last month at HBC we facilitated a large-scale mid-project retrospective for a 60 people-project team. While this project certainly didn’t start as an agile project, bringing in an agile retrospective practice helped identify significant improvements. 
This is how we did it.

# From Inquiry to Buy-in

This all started with one of the project sub-teams reaching out with an inquiry: “Can you facilitate a retrospective for us?”
That didn't sound like anything major. We've been advocating for and facilitating retrospectives on various occasions at HBC: regular Sprint retrospectives, process retrospectives, new hire onboarding retrospectives etc. 

Further digging into a list of participants revealed that this retro will be unlike any others. We were about to pull together a group of 60 people from HBC as well as from five different consulting companies(!) In spite of working on the same project for a long time, these people never had a chance to step back and reflect on how they could work together differently. 

In order to make it successful, we needed to get a buy-in from the leadership team to bring the entire team (including consultants) into the retrospective. Our first intent was to bring everyone into the same space (physical and virtual) and facilitate a retrospective with [Open Space Technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Space_Technology).
Initial response wasn’t promising: 

> “We have another problem with this retro
> […] is concerned that it is all day and that the cost of doing this meeting is like $25K-$50K”

We had to go back and re-think the retrospective approach. How can we reduce the cost of this event without affecting the depth and breadth of the insights?

# Options we considered

Thanks to the well-documented large retrospectives experiments by other agile practitioners, there was a number of options to evaluate:

1)	[Full project team, full day, face-to-face, Open Space-style retro](http://joakimsunden.com/2013/01/running-big-retrospectives-at-spotify/)
2)	[Decentralized, themes-based retros with learnings collected over a period of time and shared with the group](https://labs.spotify.com/2015/11/05/large-scale-retros/)
3)	[Decentralized retrospectives using Innovation Games Online platform](http://www.innovationgames.com/2014/06/how-to-run-huge-retrospectives/)
4)	[Overall retrospective (LeSS framework)](https://less.works/less/framework/overall-retrospective.html)

Around the same time, I was fortunate to join a Retrospective Facilitator's Gathering (RFG2017) - an annual event that brought together the most experienced retrospective facilitators from around the World. Learning from their experience as well as brainstorming together on the possible format was really helpful. I was especially greateful for the in-depth conversation with Diana Larsen in which she pointed out to 
> "clarify the goal and commitment of the key stakeholders before you start designing how to run the retrospective."

Back to the drawing board again! More conversations, clarifications and convincing... 
With some modifications and adjustments, we finally were able to get the buy-in and moved forward with the retrospective.

# What worked for us – a tiered format.

## Individual team-level retrospective

We had a mix of co-located and distributed sub-teams on this project and chose to enlist some help from multiple facilitators. To simplify data consolidation, each facilitator received a data gathering format along with a sample retrospective facilitation plan. Each individual sub-team was asked to identify two types of action items: ones that they felt were in their power to address and others that required a system-level thinking and the support from the larger project community. The former were selected by the sub-teams and put in motion by their respective owners. The latter were passed to the main facilitator for analysis and aggregation to serve as a starting point for the final retrospective.

## Final retrospective 

For the final retrospective we brought together two types of participants:

1) Leads and delegates from individual sub-teams (participated actively at all times)
2) Senior leaders of the organization (joined in the last hour to review and support team's recommendations)

The goal of this workshop was to review the recommendations from sub-teams, explore system level improvements and get the support from senior leadership to put the system-level changes into motion.

## Retrospective plans

Each retrospective was structured according to the [classic five-steps framework](https://www.amazon.com/Agile-Retrospectives-Making-Teams-Great/dp/0977616649) and included a number of activites selected from [Retromat](https://plans-for-retrospectives.com/en/).

### Sample plan for a Tier 1: Individual team-level retrospective

**Set the Stage** 

We used a happiness histogram to get things started and get a sense for how the people felt about the overall project.
![Happiness Histogram](http://i.imgur.com/iJMp2W5m.jpg)

Instead of reading the [Prime Directive](http://www.retrospectives.com/pages/retroPrimeDirective.html) once at the beginning with the team, we opted for displaying it in the room on a large poster as a visible reminder throughout the retrospective.

**Gather Data** 

Everyone was instructed to think about the things they liked about the project (**What worked well?**) and the once that could've been better (**What didn't work so well?**). In a short time-boxed silent brainstorming each team member had to come up with at least two items in each category.

Next we facilitated a pair-share activity in a "speed dating" format. Forming two lines, we asked participants to face each other and take turns discussing what each of them wrote on their post-its. After two minutes the partners were switched and the new pair were formed to continue discussion with the new people. 
The randomness of forming pairs in this activity was a great way to increase the level of energy in the room and get e

With the last partner - walk to the wall and place your post-its into one of the following quadrants: 
1) Worked Well/ Can't control 
2) Worked Well/Can control
3) Didn't work so well/Can't control
4) Didn't work so well/ Can control
* Perform affinity mapping and dot-vote on the issues in "Can control" quadrants to pick up to three issues that are in team's control.

![Quadrants](http://i.imgur.com/wW5zr4Am.jpg)

**Generate Insights/Deside What To Do**
* Self-organize into three groups, take one of the selected issues and design a team level improvement experiment to execute on it.
* Share it with the rest of the group.

**Close the Retro**
* Get the feedback on the retro format.
* Take photos of the insights generated by the team.
* Share these with the main facilitator.

### Modifications for distributed teams

For those teams that had remote team members or were fully distributed, we used a [FunRetro](http://funretro.github.io/distributed/) tool. Flexibility to configure columns and the number of votes, along with easy user interface and fun colors made this tool a good substitute for an in-room retrospective.

## Tier 2: Final Retrospective

**Duration: 3 hours**

Once all individual sub-teams retrospective were completed, we consolidated the project-level improvement proposals. These insights were reviewed, analyzed for trends and systemic issues and then shared during Tier 2 Final Retrospective.

### Final Retrospective format

**Set the stage**

We used story cubes to reflect and share how each of the participants felt about this project.

In addition, we reviewed an aggregated happiness histogram from individual teams to learn about the mood of 60 people.

**Gather data**

Since the retrospective period was very long, building a timeline together was really helpful in re-constructing the full view of the project. We asked participants to sort the events into the ones that had a positive impact on the project (placing them above the timeline) and the ones that had a negative impact on the project (placing them below the timeline). The insight we gained from this exercise alone were invaluable!

**Generate Insights**

Next we paired the participants and asked them to walk to the consolidated recommendations posters. As a pair, they were tasked with selecting the most pressing issues and bringing them back for a follow up discussion with the group.

![What Didn't](http://i.imgur.com/tkxnjwWm.jpg)


Using [LeanCoffee](http://leancoffee.org) format, participants discussed their selected highest priority issues and came up with the proposed actions.

**Decide What To Do/Close**

In the final hour of the retrospective the action owners shared their proposed next steps with the senior leadership team and reviewed the insights from the consolidated teams' feedback.

## What did we learn from this experiment?

### Worked well

* Being flexible while designing the retrospective format.
* Getting feedback on the process & tools and adapting to the project needs helped to make it work in the context of an organization.
* Involving additional facilitators speeded up execution and created a safe space for individual teams.
* People appreciated having an opportunity to share their perspective with others.
* Including consultants as well as full-time employees helped better understand the project dynamic. 
* Tapping into the knowledge of agile community and learning from the experience of others at Retrospective Facilitators Gathering. Thank you Diana Larsen, Tobias Baier, Allan Jepsen, Joanne Perold, George Dinwiddie and everyone for sharing your insights!

### Didn't work so well

* There was a common misconseption around retrospective practice, where it was equated to a project post-mortem:
-- for many of the sub-team this retrospective was the first one in 18 month

-- some even questioned the need to run it mid-project, while the project wasn't over yet.

* Bringing senior leaders into the last hour of final retrospective changed the dynamics of the discussion. We had to re-establish the safe space and collaborative environment yet again.

### What will we do about it?

* Continue promoting the retrospective practice accross the organization.
* Offer a retrospective facilitator training to Scrum Masters, Agile Project Managers and anyone who is interested in learning how to run it effectively.
* Establish retrospective facilitator circle.

Inspired by our experiment? Have your own experience worth sharing? We'd love to hear from you and learn what works in your environment.
