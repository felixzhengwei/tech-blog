Can you recall the size and length of your typical retrospective?
If your team operates by [The Scrum Guide](http://www.scrumguides.org/docs/scrumguide/v2016/2016-Scrum-Guide-US.pdf), your retrospectives likely have under ten people in one room and last three hours for a month-long Sprint (one hour for a two-weeks Sprint)

What if your current team is larger than a typical Scrum team and a retrospective period is longer than a month? What if the team members are distributed across locations, countries, time zones and multiple third party vendors? Is this retrospective doomed to fail? Not quite.
These factors just add an additional complexity and call for a different facilitation approach. 

Last month at HBC we facilitated a large-scale mid-project retrospective for a 60 people-project team. While this project certainly didn’t start as an agile project, bringing in an agile retrospective practice helped identify significant improvements. 
This is how we did it.

# From an inquiry to a buy-in

This all started with one of the project sub-teams reaching out with an inquiry: “Can you facilitate a retrospective for us?” 
Further digging into a list of participants and the goal of this retrospective uncovered additional complexity:

* Multiple locations and time zones, 
* full-time employees and consultants, 
* different level of agile experience, 
* limited travel budget etc.

In order to make it successful, we needed to get the buy-in from the leadership team to bring the entire team (including consultants) into this retrospective.
Initial response wasn’t promising: 

> “We have another problem with this retro
> […] is concerned that it is all day and that the cost of doing this meeting is like $25K-$50K”

We had to go back and re-think the retrospective approach.

# Options we considered

1)	[Full project team, full day, face-to-face, Open Space-style retro](http://joakimsunden.com/2013/01/running-big-retrospectives-at-spotify/)
2)	[Decentralized, themes-based retros with learnings collected over a period of time and shared with the group](https://labs.spotify.com/2015/11/05/large-scale-retros/)
3)	[Decentralized retrospectives using Innovation Games Online platform](http://www.innovationgames.com/2014/06/how-to-run-huge-retrospectives/)
4)	[Overall retrospective (LeSS framework)](https://less.works/less/framework/overall-retrospective.html)

# What worked for us – a tiered format.
