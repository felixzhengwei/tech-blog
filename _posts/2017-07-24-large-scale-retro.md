Can you recall the size and length of your typical retrospective?
If your team operates by [The Scrum Guide](http://www.scrumguides.org/docs/scrumguide/v2016/2016-Scrum-Guide-US.pdf), your retrospectives likely have under ten people in one room and last three hours for a month-long Sprint (one hour for a two-weeks Sprint)

What if your current team is larger than a typical Scrum team and a retrospective period is longer than a month? What if the team members are distributed across locations, countries, time zones and multiple third party vendors? Is this retrospective doomed to fail? Not quite.
These factors just add an additional complexity and call for a different facilitation approach. 

Last month at HBC we facilitated a large-scale mid-project retrospective for a 60 people-project team. While this project certainly didn’t start as an agile project, bringing in an agile retrospective practice helped identify significant improvements. 
This is how we did it.

# From an inquiry to a buy-in

This all started with one of the project sub-teams reaching out with an inquiry: “Can you facilitate a retrospective for us?” 
Further digging into a list of participants and the goal of this retrospective uncovered additional complexity:

* Multiple locations and time zones, 
* full-time employees and consultants, 
* different level of agile experience, 
* limited travel budget etc.

In order to make it successful, we needed to get the buy-in from the leadership team to bring the entire team (including consultants) into this retrospective.
Initial response wasn’t promising: 

> “We have another problem with this retro
> […] is concerned that it is all day and that the cost of doing this meeting is like $25K-$50K”

We had to go back and re-think the retrospective approach.

# Options we considered

1)	[Full project team, full day, face-to-face, Open Space-style retro](http://joakimsunden.com/2013/01/running-big-retrospectives-at-spotify/)
2)	[Decentralized, themes-based retros with learnings collected over a period of time and shared with the group](https://labs.spotify.com/2015/11/05/large-scale-retros/)
3)	[Decentralized retrospectives using Innovation Games Online platform](http://www.innovationgames.com/2014/06/how-to-run-huge-retrospectives/)
4)	[Overall retrospective (LeSS framework)](https://less.works/less/framework/overall-retrospective.html)

# What worked for us – a tiered format.

![Tiered Retro](http://i.imgur.com/35i1f82h.png)

## Tier 1: Individual team-level retrospective

We had a mix of co-located and distributed sub-teams on this project and choose to enlist help from multiple facilitators. To simplify data consolidation, each facilitator received a data gathering format along with a sample retrospective facilitation plan.

### Sample plan for a Tier 1: Individual team-level retrospective

**Duration: 1.5 - 2 hours**

**Goal:** Identify team-level improvements and uncover system level improvement opportunities to be presented at the final retrospective.

**Set the Stage** with a happiness histogram: How happy are you about the overall project (on the scale from 0 to 5)?
Review Prime directive.

![Happiness Histogram](http://i.imgur.com/iJMp2W5m.jpg)

**Gather Data** 
* Silent brainstorming: What worked well? What didn't work so well? - write at least two items in each category.
* Pair-share: Stand in a line, facing each other. Discuss with the person in front of you what each of you have written on the post-its. Switch partner after two minutes. Switch again and talk to at least three different partners.

![Pair Share](http://i.imgur.com/juJpgPwm.jpg)

With the last partner - walk to the wall and place your post-its into one of the following quadrants: 
1) Worked Well/ Can't control 
2) Worked Well/Can control
3) Didn't work so well/Can't control
4) Didn't work so well/ Can control
* Perform affinity mapping and dot-vote on the issues in "Can control" quadrants to pick up to three issues that are in team's control.

**Generate Insights/Deside What To Do**
* Self-organize into three groups, take one of the selected issues and design a team level improvement experiment to execute on it.
* Share it with the rest of the group.

**Close the Retro**
* Get the feedback on the retro format.
* Take photos of the insights generated by the team.
* Share these with the main facilitator.

### Modifications for distributed teams

For those teams that had remote team members or were fully distributed, we used a [FunRetro](http://funretro.github.io/distributed/) tool. Flexibility to configure columns and the number of votes, along with easy user interface and fun colors made this tool a good substitute for an in-room retrospective.

## Tier 2: Final Retrospective

**Duration: 3 hours**

Once all individual sub-teams retrospective were completed, we consolidated the project-level improvement proposals. These insights were reviewed, analyzed for trends and systemic issues and then shared during Tier 2 Final Retrospective.

### Participants

There were two types of participants invited to join the Final Retrospective:
1) Leads and delegates from individual sub-teams (participated actively at all times)
2) Senior leaders of the organization (joined in the last hour to review and support team's recommendations)

### Final Retrospective format

**Set the stage**

We used story cubes to reflect and share how each of the participants felt about this project.

In addition, we reviewed an aggregated happiness histogram from individual teams to learn about the mood of 60 people.

**Gather data**

Since the retrospective period was very long, building a timeline together was really helpful in re-constructing the full view of the project. We asked participants to sort the events into the ones that had a positive impact on the project (placing them above the timeline) and the ones that had a negative impact on the project (placing them below the timeline). The insight we gained from this exercise alone were invaluable!

**Generate Insights**

Next we paired the participants and asked them to walk to the consolidated recommendations posters. As a pair, they were tasked with selecting the most pressing issues and bringing them back for a follow up discussion with the group.

![What Didn't](http://i.imgur.com/tkxnjwWm.jpg)


Using [LeanCoffee](http://leancoffee.org) format, participants discussed their selected highest priority issues and came up with the proposed actions.

**Decide What To Do/Close**

In the final hour of the retrospective the action owners shared their proposed next steps with the senior leadership team and reviewed the insights from the consolidated teams' feedback.

## What did we learn from this experiment?

### Worked well

* Being flexible while designing the retrospective format.
* Getting feedback on the process & tools and adapting to the project needs helped to make it work in the context of an organization.
* Involving additional facilitators speeded up execution and created a safe space for individual teams.
* People appreciated having an opportunity to share their perspective with others.
* Including consultants as well as full-time employees helped better understand the project dynamic. 
* Tapping into the knowledge of agile community and learning from the experience of others at Retrospective Facilitators Gathering. Thank you Diana Larsen, Tobias Baier, Allan Jepsen, Joanne Perold, George Dinwiddie and everyone for sharing your insights!

### Didn't work so well

* There was a common misconseption around retrospective practice, where it was equated to a project post-mortem:
-- for many of the sub-team this retrospective was the first one in 18 month

-- some even questioned the need to run it mid-project, while the project wasn't over yet.

* Bringing senior leaders into the last hour of final retrospective changed the dynamics of the discussion. We had to re-establish the safe space and collaborative environment yet again.

### What will we do about it?

* Continue promoting the retrospective practice accross the organization.
* Offer a retrospective facilitator training to Scrum Masters, Agile Project Managers and anyone who is interested in learning how to run it effectively.
* Establish retrospective facilitator circle.

Inspired by our experiment? Have your own experience worth sharing? We'd love to hear from you and learn what works in your environment.

# World Retrospective Day

Whether you are a retrospective pro, have never tried one in the past or your experience is anywhere in between, please do yourself a favor and mark **February 6, 2018** on your calendar. 
A group of experienced retrospective facilitators is currently planning a record-breaking World Retrospective Day with live local workshops at every continent and time zone along with many on-line learning opportunities. We are engaging with the industry thought leaders to make this one of the best and most engaging learning experience. We hope to see you there!
