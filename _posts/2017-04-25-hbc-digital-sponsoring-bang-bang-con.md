On May 6-7 one of the year's most interesting events is taking place in NYC. [!!Con](http://bangbangcon.com) (pronounced "bang bang con") is two-days of ten-minute talks featuring a diverse array of [speakers and topics](http://bangbangcon.com/speakers.html). You won't find a lineup like this at your typical tech conference - punch cards, cyborgs, glowing mushrooms, queer feminist cyberpunk manifestos and airplane noise are just a few of the topics on the agenda.

Given the excitement around this conference, tickets went fast --- *sold-out-in-minutes-fast* --- but there will be videos and a live stream so not all is lost. Stay tuned to the @bangbangcon Twitter account for more info. 

We're thrilled to be supporting this year's bangbangcon as an AWESOME! Sponsor. If you'll be there, make sure to say hi to one of our friendly engineers and snag some HBC Digital swag!
